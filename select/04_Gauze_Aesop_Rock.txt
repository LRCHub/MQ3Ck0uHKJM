Some of you know me already
Those of you who don't
You're in for a great big fucking surprise
For those of you who do
Can expect an infinitely
More horrible time than they care to remember
I drag in the cat that
Drag in the conversation piece
Yahweh-forsaken elite, hemlock in the pot
Every day of the week, i'm a lot
Reach in, even the odds or evolve
Into mystery meat for the broth
Who's еatin'?
Scream for his mom all evening
Moxiе a seasonal fog palmful of grease
Skied through "Keep Out" signage
Weed in his sock, beacon of snot
Knee deep evil to plot through a fever
Maid threw his Rod of Asclepius out
Spring and bell exploding through my Polartec
Got a soul and vessel, don't coalesce
Got a nosy compulsion to overstep
I write 8-bit maps for the so depressed
From the croc in the moat to
The gold in the chest
Notice I don't program any
Actual way to progress to convey an effect
Hot Vinyasa to bated breath
That fray, that plague, that bayonet
That hate, that face of death
That all-in together
I'm afraid that train has left
I ain't wade through bullshit or baby step
Pop off into flesh, no beta test
I bump Raising Hell, I make raisin bread
Raised on wolf's milk and Eraserhead
I'm all good
Quietly hacking away at a hideous
Riff on the formula
What is the work if it isn't a
Ticket to slip into vivid euphoria? Huh?
(You know we're being watched)
(You know we're being watched)
I brought gauze two kind of knives
Carrots for the horse tie his own flies
If you're coming, bring soap
Something for the cough
A million feet of rope maybe more gauze
(One, two three four)
Ayy, grey beard, wayward
Parade wave and vacate the framework
Phased out, trade for blank
Tapes and bait worms, eek
Ease in the weeds, no safe word, K?
No kayfabe, all true tales from the pay grade
Heavy on malaise and away games
The tiptoe tailed by a trail of craters
I am way too Canis Major, et tus?
Let me guess, you tout the brave few
Then make Jesus take the wheel by day two
I don't really pander or plan to behave
If the police sketches a hand from the grave
Unholy don't luminol the upholstery
His poor old Nonna would roll on her rosary
I know i go from a homie to bogey and ghost
I'm sorry if you know me as both
I still float hearts from the haystack
I give free hugs in a plague mask
I don't trust none of y'all's love to be more
Than a cheap toy gun with a bang flag
Ayy, sultan of simple fare
No lie, roll by, we can lick the air
It's an appeasement gesture
Not a rib tip rare
But the bistro don't split silver hairs
I made peace with a lot
But a lot of it sit's
Still, genuine props on the bottomless pit
Backseat drive with a lazy drawl
I don't aim to please, I don't aim at all
I'm okay actively seeking to underdevelop
His sentimentality
Why am I here if it isn't effectively
Cutting the hellions out of me, huh?
(You know we're being watched)
(You know we're being watched)
I brought gauze half a dozen flares
Couple clean jars strike anywheres
If you're coming, bring fuel
Map of the stars any canned food
Maybe more gauze
See? I got a rope a camping knife with an
It'sy-bit'sy fork and spoon
And a place to hang my canteen
