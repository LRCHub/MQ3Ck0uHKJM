Medicated dull, your attention
Dry winter miles, diamonds and glass
Cheaters hands, you never take care
You never take care, stars are out
Spilling from afraid of flying
Trembling planes, diamonds and glass

Mink eyed, marble eyed
In the gauze, in the weeds
By the drain, red on pale
There's a nail by the vent
Sweet for your heel in the gauze
Marble eyed, waiting there,
Kiss your mouth to shut you up

Crossed and lowered, cheaters fine
Wings on fire, the stars are out
Whisper stung in the wires
All you steal, you never take care

Mink eyed, marble eyed
In the gauze, in the weeds
By the drain, red on pale
There's a nail by the vent
Sweet for your heel in the gauze
Marble eyed, waiting there
Kiss your mouth to shut you up
