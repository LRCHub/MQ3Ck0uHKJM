You think you love him
Or someone like him
He reminds you of a boy
You dated once or twice

Just about the same size
Just about the same eyes
The only difference being
The cadence in his voice

So much in common
Moving out of caption
Or silky like the spider's web
So fragile in the wind

And the chains that bind us
Serving to remind us
Anchors hold the ships at bay
When high tides rush in

Ah now, maybe your tattoo
Or a name lit in the tile
I guess you think he's staying for a while
Or something to remember

A feign and distant smile
I bet you plan on staying for a while
I guess you plan on staying for a while
I guess you plan on staying for a while

It's kinda frantic
We all long to be romantic
You try to give yourself away
And hope he never leaves

But nothing matters
When heart goes pitter-patter
No sense of unconditioned
It's me who you deceived

Ah yeah, a window with a view
A present, past and future
Wrapped in the gauze of friendship anew

And mothers without fathers
To help install the colors
Wrapped in the gauze of friendship anew
Wrapped in the gauze of friendship anew
Wrapped in the gauze of friendship anew

It's kinda funny
Today it might turn sunny
The birds are coming back
From winter flights away

And if you miss them
I'll be sure to wish them
A welcome back from both of us
And hope that they might stay
