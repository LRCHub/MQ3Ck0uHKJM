Follow you're learning from the contact
Who tore it from it's blue seams
You're asking for me last week
With the girl you met in high school
Who smells just like the old nights
You spent at the house
Do you remember how we used to be?
Cologne in the bathroom
Where we used to read
I lost you in the storm
I lost you in the storm
Holy like the things you said in college
You promised in the summer
You'd mention my name cooler
Was the peril of the weekend
When you wanted all the bad lights
To color the same
Do you remember how we used to be?
Cologne in the bathroom
Where we used to read
I lost you in the storm
I lost you in the storm
Do you remember how we used to be?
Cologne in the bathroom
Where we used to read
I lost you in the storm
I lost you in the storm
I lost you in the storm
I lost you in the storm
And I like that you were the only one
Pulling offers for all the shit I'd done
But you were not like them
You were not like them
I lost it on you the other day
'Cause I'm scared that these
Things'll never stay you only remind them
You only remind them
